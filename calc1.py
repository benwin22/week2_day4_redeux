 #1) Create a Module in VS Code and Import It into jupyter notebook
# Module should have the following capabilities:

# 1a) Has a function to calculate the square footage of a house
# Reminder of Formula: Length X Width == Area
# 1b) Has a function to calculate the circumference of a circle 2 Pi r

# Program in Jupyter Notebook should take in user input and use imported functions to calculate a circle's circumference or a houses square footage


def area(x,y):
    return (x*y)
def circ(r):
    return(r * 2 * 3.14)
